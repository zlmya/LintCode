Description
      Implement a Rectangle class which include the following attributes and methods:

      Two public attributes width and height.
      A constructor which expects two parameters width and height of type int.
      A method getArea which would calculate the size of the rectangle and return.

Example
    Example1:
    Java:
        Rectangle rec = new Rectangle(3, 4);
        rec.getArea(); // should get 12，3*4=12
    Example2:
    Java:
        Rectangle rec = new Rectangle(4, 4);
        rec.getArea(); // should get 16，4*4=16

My Submission:
    public class Rectangle {
        /*
         * Define two public attributes width and height of type int.
         */
        // write your code here
        int width = 0;
        int height = 0;
        /*
         * Define a constructor which expects two parameters width and height here.
         */
        // write your code here
        public Rectangle(int width, int height){
            this.width = width;
            this.height = height;
        }

        /*
         * Define a public method `getArea` which can calculate the area of the
         * rectangle and return.
         */
        // write your code here
        public int getArea(){
            return this.width * this.height;
        }
    }
